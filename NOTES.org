token definitions:
sender: person sending the token
receiver: person receiving the token

founding process definitions:
founder: self-explanatory
backing: act of sending money to contract
backer: person who backs Golem
crowdfunding: time when backing is done
withdrawal: act of taking ethers from contract by founder

1) contract has a starting TSTART and ending TEND point in time t
   1) at creation moment t < TSTART
   2) TSTART < TEND
   3) * backing is possible if t >= TSTART AND t <= TEND
   4) * backing is not possible if t < TSTART or t > TEND
2) crowdfunding can be ended prematurely
   1) it can be ended if t >= TSTART and t < TEND
   2) if can't be ended if t < TSTART or t > TEND
3) ended crowdfunding prevents backing
   1) * backing is not possible if crowdfunding is ended
   2) * backing is not possible if t < TSTART or t > TEND
4) withdrawal is possible only after end of crowdfunding
   1) withdrawal is possible if t > TEND OR crowdfunding has ended
   2) only founder can withdraw money
   3) failed withdrawal does not make money disappear
5) crowdfunding has an upper limit LIMIT
   1) LIMIT > 0
   2) * backing is possible if CURRENT + AMOUNT <= LIMIT
   3) * backing is not possible if CURRENT + AMOUNT > LIMIT
   4) backing can't generate more than LIMIT*M GNT on all balances
   5) * backing to the LIMIT enables transfer
6) backing bumps backers token account proportionally to multiplier M
   1) backing bumps backer's account by amount*M
   2) backing does not bump someone else's account
   3) * sum of ETH in contract is equal to amount of backing in ETH
   4) * sum of GNT in token contract is equal to amount of backing in ETH * M
7) founder can be changed
   1) founder can appoint other founder
   2) non-founder can't change founder
8) transfer is possible if crowdfunding has ended
   1) transfer is possible if t > TEND
   2) * transfer is not possible if t < TSTART
   3) * transfer is possible if t > TSTART AND terminated prematurely
   4) * transfer is not possible if t < TEND AND not terminated prematurely
   5) * failed transfer does not change balances or total supply
9) transfer is correct
   1) only sender can send his money
   2) on transfer of X GNT, X is taken from senders account
   3) on transfer of X GNT, X is added to receivers account
   4) if transfer fails, money is refunded
