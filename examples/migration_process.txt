Migration process outline.

Prerequisites:
1. A valid and working GolemNetworkToken contract (a finalized one)
2. The address of GolemNetworkToken contract's founder

Steps:
1. Create MigrationAgent contract (provide the address of the GolemNetworkToken contract which is going to be migrated as an input parameter)
2. Create GNTTargetToken (provide the address of the created MigrationAgent contract as an input parameter)
3. Set GolemNetworkToken's migration agent's address to the freshly created MigrationAgent contract's address (GolemNetworkToken.setMigrationAgent method)
4. At this point everything is set up and migration can be announced. Each GNT owner has to call GolemNetworkToken.migrate method to migrate tokens to the new contract
5. After the migration is finished the MigrationAgent.finalizeMigration method is called by the owner of the MigrationAgent contract (a gentle cleanup)
